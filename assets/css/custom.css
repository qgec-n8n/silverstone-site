/*
  Custom responsiveness overrides

  This stylesheet contains overrides to ensure the layout scales gracefully
  across all desktop viewport sizes without relying on a global page‑wide
  transform.  The hero sections already occupy the full viewport height via
  the base styles.  These rules enforce a consistent two‑column layout for
  service rows regardless of window width, and a fixed four‑column grid for
  the Innovation Gallery.  They use `!important` to supersede conflicting
  declarations in the main stylesheet.
*/

/* Always display service rows as two columns.  The site’s base CSS
   collapses these to a single column on narrow viewports.  By defining
   `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr` globally with `!important`, we ensure
   service images and text remain side by side even on very narrow windows. */
.service-row {
  display: grid !important;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr !important;
  gap: 2rem !important;
  align-items: stretch !important;
}

/* Maintain alternating order on even service rows.  When a service row is
   displayed as a grid, the `order` property still applies.  This ensures
   the image and text swap positions every other row to preserve the
   designed rhythm. */
.service-row:nth-of-type(even) .service-image {
  order: 2 !important;
}
.service-row:nth-of-type(even) .service-content {
  order: 1 !important;
}

/* Always force the Innovation Gallery into a 4×2 grid.  The base styles
   use `auto-fit` to change the number of columns based on available
   space, but for a uniform look we fix it at four columns at all
   viewport sizes.  Images will automatically scale down to fit but
   maintain their aspect ratio. */
